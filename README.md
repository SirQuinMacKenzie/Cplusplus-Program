# Cplusplus-Program
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  The project was a clock menu that would track updates to the clock and display it in both 24-hour and 12-hour formats.
What did you do particularly well?
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  Answering all three of these questions, I am particularly proud of the menu and clock formatting for the outputs, but knowing more now, I believe it can be improved upon and condensed significantly.
  The repeated lines that define the border and spaces in the output can be automated without having to manually type out the output lines, and it would result in more uniform outputs.
  If done as a seperate class as well, the formatting could be easily updated or be swapped out later if the need arose.
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  Working in the language of C++ was valuable in of itself, and the loops and other ideas implemented in this project was reinstated and adjusted for other projects that required menu loops like in this program.
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  I did my best to keep everything in neat blocks based on their function, and outlined the program with comments beforehand to help not only with planning but also contributing to readability.
